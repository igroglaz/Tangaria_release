# Timed player properties
#
# Descriptions, messages and message types can be edited without bad effects.
# Changing fail may have unpredictable results.
# Changing the name or adding whole new entries will severely disrupt the game.
# It should only be done when list-player-timed.h (and other code) is also being
# changed, and the game recompiled.
# Changing a resist line will have to match to one of the hard-coded elements
# from list-elements.h; currently, those resist lines are used to filter out
# unnecessary messages when timed effects lapse and to affect selection of
# randart activations.
# Changing a brand or slay line will have to match to an entry in brand.txt or
# slay.txt, respectively; besides the effect on combat, those lines also
# affect selection of randart activations.
# Changing a flag-synonym line will have to match to an entry, of type flag, in
# object_property.txt; those lines are currently used to filter out unnecessary
# messages when timed effects lapse and to affect selection of randart
# activations.

# === Understanding player_timed.txt ===

# name - the effect name; the name must match the first argument to one of the
#        TMD() macros in list-player-timed.h
# desc - the effect description
# grade - specify a grade for this effect; most effects only have two grades:
#         off (implicit for all effects, maximum of 0, no transition messages)
#         and on (the one grade specified for the effect in this file)
#         param one: color used on the status line for this effect when in this
#             grade; may be a one letter color code or the full color name
#             (case insensitive)
#         param two: is the maximum for this grade; to work properly must be
#             greater than zero, less than 32768, and greater than the maximum
#             for any previous grades specified for this effect
#         param three: is the name of the grade and will be shown in the status
#             line; use a one character long name for the grade to suppress
#             showing the timed effect in the status line when in that grade
#         param four: is the message to display when the effect enters this
#             grade from a lower grade; no message will be displayed if the
#             message is one character long
#         param five (optional): is the message to display when the effect
#             enters this grade from a higher grade; no message will be
#             displayed if this parameter is omitted
# on-end - the message on ending the effect
# on-increase - the message on the effect increasing
# on-decrease - the message on the effect decreasing
# near-begin - the message on beginning the effect for nearby players
# near-end - the message on ending the effect for nearby players
# msgt - the message type to use for the change of grade, on-increase, and
#        on-decrease messages for this effect; the type must either match
#        (case-insensitive) the first argument to one of the MSG() macros in
#        list-message.h or be an unsigned integer less than MSG_MAX which is
#        the index of the message type to use within list-message.h; on-end
#        messages always use the RECOVER message type; for the textui user
#        interface, the message type affects the message color (configured
#        globally by lib/customize/message.prf; also configurable by
#        preferences in the user's files) and the sound played when the
#        message is displayed (configured globally by lib/customize/sound.prf;
#        also configurable by preferences in the user's files)
# fail - determines what makes the effect fail; may be specified more than
#        once - the effect will fail if any of the conditions are met
#        param one:
#          1 - object flag
#          2 - resist
#          3 - vulnerability
#          4 - player flag
#          5 - presence of timed effect
#        param two:
#          the actual flag that causes the failure; for an object flag, the
#          flag must match the first argument to one of the OF() macros in
#          list-object-flags.h; for a player flag, the flag must match the
#          first argument to one of the PF() macros in list-player-flags.h; for
#          a resist or vulnerability, the flag must match the argument to one
#          of the ELEM() macros in list-elements.h; for a timed effect, the
#          flag must match the argument to TMD() macros list-player-timed.h
# on-begin-effect - (optional) specifies an effect to be invoked when the
#                   timed effect starts; can be used more than once - the
#                   additional effects will be executed in the order in which
#                   they appear
#                   param one: name of the effect (argument to one of the
#                       EFFECT() macros in list-effects.h)
#                   param two: name of the subtype of the effect; can be
#                       omitted
#                   param three: radius of the effect; can be omitted and
#                       must be omitted if the subtype is omitted
#                   param four: the "other" parameter for the effect; can be
#                       omitted and must be omitted if the subtype or radius is
#                       omitted
# on-end-effect - (optional) specifies an effect to be invoked when the timed
#                 effect lapses; can be used more than once - the additional
#                 effects will be executed in the order in which they appear
#                 param one: name of the effect (argument to one of the
#                     EFFECT() macros in list-effects.h)
#                 param two: name of the subtype of the effect; can be omitted
#                 param three: radius of the effect; can be omitted and must
#                     be omitted if the subtype is omitted
#                 param four: the "other" parameter for the effect; can be
#                     omitted and must be omitted if the subtype or radius is
#                     omitted
# effect-yx - (optional) specifies the y and x parameters of the most recently
#             set effect (i.e. from a prior on-begin-effect or on-end-effect
#             directive)
#             param one: is the value of the y parameter for the effect
#             param two: is the value of hte x parameter for the effect
# effect-dice - (optional) specifies the dice string for the most recently
#               set effect (i.e. from a prior on-begin-effect or on-end-effect
#               directive)
# effect-expr - (optional) defines an expression for the dice string of the
#               most recently set effect (i.e. from a prior on-begin-effect
#               or on-end-effect directive); requires that the dice string has
#               been set for the effect with a effect-dice directive
#               param one: is the name of the variable to substitute with the
#                   value of the expression; variable names must be all
#                   capital letters and a reference to a variable in a dice
#                   string starts with a $; if the dice string does not contain
#                   a reference to the given variable, parsing of the game's
#                   data files will stop with an error
#               param two: set the name of the base value to modify with the
#                   operations in the third parameter; the name can be one of
#                   those listed below; if it does not match any in the list,
#                   the base value will be zero
#                     PLAYER_LEVEL - the player's level
#                     DUNGEON_LEVEL - the dungeon's level
#                     MAX_SIGHT - the maximum sight range, in grids
#                     WEAPON_DAMAGE - a random roll for the base damage (only
#                         the weapon's dice and damage modifiers are included;
#                         no damage modifiers from the player or equipment
#                         other than the weapon are used) of the player's
#                         equipped weapon; if the player has no equipped
#                         weapon, the value of this is zero
#                    PLAYER_HP - the player's current number of hit points
#                    MONSTER_PERCENT_HP_GONE - ((maximum hit points for the
#                         player's target monster - current hit poinst for the
#                         player's target monster) * 100) / maximum hit points
#                         for the player's target monster or 0 if the player
#                         doesn't currently have a targeted monster
#               param three: sets the operations to perform on the base value to
#                   get the value substituted into the dice expression; for
#                   instance, "* 2 / 3" would multiply the base value by 2 then
#                   divide that result by three, discarding any remainder;
#                   operators that are allowed are '+' (addition),
#                   '-' (subtraction), '*' (multiplication), '/' (integer
#                   division; discards remainder), and 'n' or 'N' (either negate
#                   the result from before the operator); integer constants
#                   in the operations must be between -32768 and 32767;
#                   operators and integer constants in the operations should be
#                   separated by single spaces
# effect-msg - (optional) appends to the message associated with the most
#              recently set effect (i.e. from a prior on-begin-effect or
#              on-end-effect directive); how that  message is used depends on
#              the effect - typically it may be printed during the effect or
#              is used as a death message
# resist - (optional) when this timed property is active, the recipient gain
#          a temporary resistance to the named element
# brand - (optional) when this timed property is active, the recipient gains
#         the given brand (by its code in brand.txt) on equipped weapons; when
#         there's no brand line, the timed property does not induce a brand
# slay - (optional) when this timed property is active, the recipient gains
#        the given slay (by its code in slay.txt) on equipped weapons; when
#        there's no slay line, the timed property does not induce a slay
# flag-synonym - (optional) indicate that this timed property is (largely)
#                synonymous to the object property of type flag in
#                object_property.txt with the code given by the first parameter;
#                if the second parameter is not zero, this timed property is an
#                exact synonym, except for duration; if the second parameter is
#                zero, the timed property has other effects that are not
#                implied by the named object property
# lower-bound - (optional) overrides the default lower bound of zero for the
#               timed effect; the lower bound must be non-negative, less
#               than 32768, and less than or equal to the maximum for any of
#               the timed effect's grades; if the lower bound is greater than
#               zero, the timed effect is always active (so a message set by
#               on-end or an effect by on-begin-effect or on-end-effect will
#               not be used)
# flags - (optional) specifies one or more flags for the timed effect; can
#         appear more than once with all the flags specified accumulating;
#         more than one flag can be specified each time it is used - the names
#         of the flags must be separated by spaces or '|'; the flag names or
#         that are understood are:
#         NONSTACKING - any attempt to increase the timed effect while it is
#             already active will not increase the duration; this is a stronger
#             restriction than having the timed effect fail because of the
#             timed effect itself, primarily because NONSTACKING also affects
#             cases, like TIMED_INC_NO_RES effects, where the failure check is
#             bypassed; NONSTACKING is also handled differently than failing
#             for the timed effect itself in terms of lore checks (if a timed
#             effect is NONSTACKING, lore for a monster won't show that a
#             the monster's attack inflicting that status is resisted solely
#             because the character is already subject to the timed effect)
