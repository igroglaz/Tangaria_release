# === Understanding curse.txt ===

# name: effect name
# type: valid object base
# combat: to_hit : to_dam : to_ac
# effect: random effect : parameter : parameter : parameter
# dice: dice string
# expr: dice expression
# time: average frequency of random effect
# flags: flag | flag | etc.
# values: label[value] | label[value] | etc.
# msg: text
# desc: description
# conflict: curse_name
# conflict-flags: flag | flag | etc.

# 'type' appends a kind of object (from object_base.txt) to the kinds which
# can be afflicted with the curse.

# 'combat' sets the adjustments to to-hit, to-damage, and AC for a cursed
# object. If not supplied, the adjustments are all zero.

# 'effect' sets the name of the effect that'll randomly trigger on the cursed
# object. The fields are the name of the effect (from src/list-effects.h),
# the subtype which is either an index or a name (look at effect_subtype()
# in src/effects.c for more information), the radius, and the other parameter.
# The effect name is required. The others are optional, and the trailing ones
# that are unused can be omitted.

# 'dice' provides a random value to be used by the effect (for damage, healing,
# duration, ...).

# 'expr' provides an expression for use in the dice value for the effect.
# It consists of a code letter (eg B) for the expression, a base function to
# use (for example PLAYER_LEVEL), and a sequence of operations to perform on
# that base.

# 'msg' sets the text to display when the curse effect triggers. If there are
# multiple 'msg' lines for a curse, they'll be concatenated.

# 'time' sets a random expression. Each time the curse effect happens, that
# expression will be reevaluated to determine the number of turns until the
# next time the curse effect will happen.

# 'flags' is for the flags that the cursed object will have. Those flags can
# either be object flags (as found in src/list-object-flags.h) or element
# flags (IGNORE_ or HATES_ with an element name from src/list-elements.h
# appended). As many 'flags' lines may be used as are needed to specify all
# of the flags. More than one flag can be set per line: use '|' to separate
# one flag from the next.

# 'values' is for the object modifiers which take a value (stats, resistances,
# and so on) that'll be present on the cursed item. Like 'flags', values
# are separated by '|' and as many 'values' lines as needed can be used.

# 'desc' is for the description of the curse. It will be included in the
# description of the cursed object when the curse is known. As many 'desc'
# lines may be used as are needed to describe the curse.

# 'conflict' sets the name of a curse that conflicts with this curse.
# Two curses that conflict will not both be present on an object. You may
# use multiple 'conflict' lines to specify that this curse conflicts with
# more than one other curse.

# 'conflict-flags' lists the object flags (from src/list-object-flags.h) that
# conflict with this curse: this curse will not appear on an object that has
# one or more of those flags. More than one flag can be included on the line:
# separate them with '|', and more than one 'conflicts-flags' lines may be
# used to specify all of the conflicting flags.




#/// Note: if you don't specify any 'type' for a curse,
#/// it won't appear on randarts or any other items (good for truearts/nazgul rings)
