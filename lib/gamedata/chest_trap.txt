# File: chest_trap.txt

# This file contains chest trap definitions

### Understanding chest_trap.txt ###

# name: name
# code: code to indicate the trap's presence (see chest.txt)
# level: minimum object level of chest for this trap to appear on
#    The maximum for this should be less than the maximum value for the
#    level of a chest in object.txt (currently 55).
# effect: trap effect : ? subtype : ? radius : ? extra parameter
# dice: dice string for effect
# expr: dice expression for effect
# destroy: 1 if the chest is destroyed
# magic: 1 if the trap is magical (as opposed to physical)
# msg: activation message
#    This is shown to the user when the trap is triggered.
# msg-death: death message
#    This is shown to the user if the trap kills the character.

# The traps in this file should follow these rules:
#  1. The first entry should be the "no trap";
#  2. Traps should appear in ascending order of level;
#  3. There should be no more than 14 traps total.

# Current disarming difficulty calculations depend on there being six types
# of trap; if there are more than six, those calculations will need to change.


# TODO: make chest the only source of... something valuable and interesting
# eg runes like in D2.. or maybe CHR pots?

#### There should be no more than 14 traps total!!! (so we are full already)
