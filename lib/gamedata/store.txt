#
#############################################
# You can put "always" items inside, the code allows that for all stores. However,
# by doing this, you need to remove the items you  add from all other stores (for
# example: if you add "Cure Critical Wounds" to the BM as a staple, you need to remove
# them from  # the Temple as "normal" items), otherwise the item would not appear in the BM.
#
# 3) Max store item is 24 (possible to change that in constants.txt). This means that slots:
# max + number of "always" items in a store should never be greater than 24.
#
# Store must have more than one owner, otherwise the shuffle feature will loop
# endlessly (Angband stores all have 4). If you #want only one, just duplicate the entry.
#
# example of normal:food:Ration of Food:10:300:
# '10' means it would be 10 times less often then for common (1) items
# 300 is 300% price increase from 'cost' from object.txt

normal:fortune cookie:There is an inn, a merry old inn
normal:fortune cookie:beneath an old grey hill,
normal:fortune cookie:And there they brew a beer so brown
normal:fortune cookie:That the Man in the Moon himself came down
normal:fortune cookie:One night to drink his fill.
normal:fortune cookie:The ostler has a tipsy cat
normal:fortune cookie:that plays a five-stringed fiddle;
normal:fortune cookie:And up and down he runs his bow,
normal:fortune cookie:Now squeaking high, now purring low,
normal:fortune cookie:Now sawing in the middle.
normal:fortune cookie:The landlord keeps a little dog
normal:fortune cookie:that is mighty fond of jokes;
normal:fortune cookie:When there's good cheer among the guests,
normal:fortune cookie:He cocks an ear at all the jests
normal:fortune cookie:And laughs until he chokes.
normal:fortune cookie:They also keep a horned cow
normal:fortune cookie:as proud as any queen;
normal:fortune cookie:But music turns her head like ale,
normal:fortune cookie:And makes her wave her tufted tail
normal:fortune cookie:and dance upon the green.
normal:fortune cookie:And O! the rows of silver dishes
normal:fortune cookie:and the store of silver spoons!
normal:fortune cookie:For Sunday there's a special pair,
normal:fortune cookie:And these they polish up with care
normal:fortune cookie:on Saturday afternoons.
normal:fortune cookie:The Man in the Moon was drinking deep,
normal:fortune cookie:and the cat began to wail;
normal:fortune cookie:A dish and a spoon on the table danced,
normal:fortune cookie:The cow in the garden madly pranced,
normal:fortune cookie:and the little dog chased his tail.
normal:fortune cookie:The Man in the Moon took another mug,
normal:fortune cookie:and then rolled beneath his chair;
normal:fortune cookie:And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,
normal:fortune cookie:Till in the sky the stars were pale,
normal:fortune cookie:and dawn was in the air.
normal:fortune cookie:Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat
normal:fortune cookie:The white horses of the Moon,
normal:fortune cookie:They neigh and champ their silver bits;
normal:fortune cookie:But their master's been and drowned his wits,
normal:fortune cookie:and the Sun'll be rising soon!'
normal:fortune cookie:So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle
normal:fortune cookie:a jig that would wake the dead
normal:fortune cookie:He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,
normal:fortune cookie:While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon
normal:fortune cookie:'It's after three!' he said.
normal:fortune cookie:They rolled the Man slowly up the hill
normal:fortune cookie:and bundled him into the Moon,
normal:fortune cookie:While his horses galloped up in rear,
normal:fortune cookie:And the cow came capering like a deer,
normal:fortune cookie:and a dish ran up with the spoon.
normal:fortune cookie:Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;
normal:fortune cookie:the dog began to roar,
normal:fortune cookie:The cow and the horses stood on their heads;
normal:fortune cookie:The guests all bounded from their beds
normal:fortune cookie:and danced upon the floor.
normal:fortune cookie:With a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke!
normal:fortune cookie:the cow jumped over the Moon,
normal:fortune cookie:And the little dog laughed to see such fun,
normal:fortune cookie:And the Saturday dish went off at a run
normal:fortune cookie:with the silver Sunday spoon.
normal:fortune cookie:The round Moon rolled behind the hill
normal:fortune cookie:as the Sun raised up her head.
normal:fortune cookie:She hardly believed her fiery eyes;
normal:fortune cookie:For though it was day, to her surprise
normal:fortune cookie:they all went back to bed!
