# Object generation
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Maximum depth used in object allocation
obj-make:max-depth:100
##it means you can get objects from level 0 to 100
##if for example you reduce it to 50, anything that is greater level than 50
## would never be generated like deep books or rings of speed or power dsm

# Chance of object being "good"
# The actual chance is MIN(good-obj + object level, 100)
obj-make:good-obj:33
##eg for '33': chance of beign good is 33% in town, 100% after dungeon level 67


# Chance of object being "great"
obj-make:ego-obj:15
##currently any object has % chance flat of becoming ego
###30->15

# 1/chance of inflating the requested object level
obj-make:great-obj:40
##1/.. chance to get an out of depth item
## (for example the potion of experience you got at 50ft)
###20->40

# 1/chance of inflating the requested ego item level
obj-make:great-ego:25
##the chance of getting a better ego
##armor of resist acid -> low levle, armor of elvenkind = high level
##so 1/.. chance of getting a higher level ego (out of depth ego)
###20->25

# Constants for critical calculations
# In general, those calculations compute the chance for a critical
# from a linear combination of the to-hit bonuses, the player's
# to-hit skill, the player's level, and the weapon or missile's
# weight. If a critical happens, they then compute the power (i.e.
# severity of the critical) from a random term and the weapon or
# missile's weight. For more details see critical_melee() and
# critical_shot() in player-attack.c.

# critical when the target is debuffed

# Define each of the levels for melee criticals. If no critical levels are
# defined, then there's no extra damage due to critical hits.
# The first value is the cutoff for the power. Any critical which has a power
# less than that cutoff and is not covered by a lower power level will fall
# in that level. The cutoff for the last level is not used and that level
# will catch any criticals not caught by the previous levels. To be valid,
# the cutoffs for all levels but the last must be in scrictly ascending order.
# The second value is the damage multiplier for that power level.
# The third value is the amount added to the damage for that power level.
# The fourth value is the name of the message, from list-messages.h, to use when
# a critical happens for that power level.
