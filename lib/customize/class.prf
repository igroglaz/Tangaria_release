class:Warrior
help:A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most problems
help: by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
help: a magical device. Their prime stats are strength, constitution, and
help: dexterity, and they will strike more blows with melee weapons than any
help: other class. Warriors excel at fighting, shooting and throwing, but
help: perform poorly at most other skills. A warrior has bad stealth and
help: cannot learn any spells.

class:Archer
help:An Archer can shoot a squirrel in the eye so fur would not be spoiled.
help: Masters of ranged combat, they don't really know from which side to
help: hold a sword; they don't need one honestly.
help: With the ability to hurl multiple arrows at long distances, an Archer
help: can inflict more damage in a single turn than any other character class,
help: including mages. However, outside of their powerful bow, Archers are
help: relatively weak compared to other classes.
help: They lack healing and defensive spells that magical classes possess
help: to compensate. Archers excel particularly with bows, achieving incredible
help: speed and precision far superior to crossbows or slings. With experience,
help: some Archers learn to coat their arrows with poison or use sharper tips
help: to inflict deeper wounds.|
help: |
help:Also they can see farther than others.

class:Monk
help:Monks are warriors who fight barehanded, forgoing weapons and bows. Their
help: training in martial arts makes them exceptionally powerful without armor
help: or weapons. As they advance in levels, they gain new techniques to hit
help: opponents more effectively and receive extra damage, defense, and attacks
help: per round.
help: Monk abilities by level:|
help: |
help:- Level 10: fall like a feather.|
help: |
help:- Level 15: resistance to fear.|
help: |
help:- Level 20: resistance to confusion.|
help: |
help:- Level 25: resistance to paralysis.|
help: |
help:In time, a monk can learn how to stun and slow opponents.
help: They must wear light armor to stay unencumbered and fully benefit from
help: their class bonuses. Monks don't use mana at all, but monastic training
help: makes them faster than any other character class! They can also throw
help: objects with surprising accuracy.

class:Mage
help:A Mage relies on their wits to survive. They cannot hope to simply hack
help: their way through the dungeon, and must therefore use magic to
help: defeat, deceive, confuse, and escape. A mage is incomplete without
help: an assortment of magical devices to complement their spells. They can
help: master high-level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and
help: have excellent saving throws to resist effects of spells cast at them.
help: However, they are incredibly weak, getting few hit dice and suffering strong
help: penalties to strength and constitution. Intelligence is their primary stat
help: and at high levels they can cast many spells without chance of failure.
help: There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells
help: are their true realm, and they will get fewer blows with melee weapons than
help: other classes.|
help: |
help:Their spells range widely - from simple detection and teleportation
help: to powerful elemental blasts and protective wards, with the Fireball spell
help: being their specialty. They are also skilled at making some spells pierce
help: through multiple enemies in a line.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned casters.

class:Shaman
help:A Shaman is a lover of nature, and at one with the natural world. Shamans
help: have control over their environment and direct power over creatures, leading
help: even to the ability to take their forms. As they grow stronger, they can
help: transform into mightier beasts, from bears to mythical creatures.|
help: |
help:Shaman skills are moderate, with some fighting ability, especially
help: when transformed. They shape the flow of events to their purpose rather
help: than relying on devices or missiles, but at high levels gain access to
help: potent nature-based magic. They call upon raw natural forces, conjuring
help: storms, quakes, and poison clouds. Shamans can calm, slow, or drive away
help: foes, bending even the wildest beasts to their will. They harness the
help: healing power of the wild to restore health and vitality. Their magic
help: shapes the land itself - raising trees, splitting stone, and shaking
help: the earth. Their senses extend beyond normal sight, revealing life, hidden
help: paths, and forgotten lore. Shamans rely on wisdom and possess good saving throws.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned wardens.

class:Priest
help:A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the dungeon only
help: to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to
help: fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their temple!
help: Priests receive their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose
help: which spells they will learn. Their prayers heal and protect, but
help: can also bring ruin to the wicked. They are especially strong against
help: evil beings, standing firm with divine power. Over time, priests gain
help: ways to shield themselves, support allies, and even reshape the world
help: around them.|
help: |
help:They are familiar with magical devices, preferring to call them
help: "instruments of God", but are not as skilled as mages in their use.
help: Priests have great saving throws and make passable fighters, better
help: if they can find a blessed weapon. Wisdom is their primary stat
help: and at high levels they can cast many prayers without chance
help: of failure. Priests have poor stealth.|
help: |
help:Though initially weak, priests can become decent fighters
help: who strongly prefer blunt weapons over edged ones; wielding non-blessed
help: weapons results in severe penalties.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned preachers.

class:Warlock
help:A Warlock must live by his wits. He cannot hope to simply hack his way
help: through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat,
help: deceive, confuse, and escape. |
help: |
help:Warlocks seek to master the spirits of sentient creatures, creating
help: servants of their own will. They walk a dark and wicked path, risking
help: harm to their own body and mind. They love shadows and hate light,
help: automatically shrouding themselves in darkness. Their magic summons,
help: commands, and banishes spirits, blurring the boundary between
help: life and death. With time, they transcend mortal flesh, embracing darker
help: forms...|
help: |
help:Their spells demand high intelligence and frequently harm the caster or
help: place them in danger. In return, they achieve awesome power at high levels.
help: The ultimate aim of the warlock is to supplant the Dark Enemy and set
help: up a tyranny in his place.|
help: |
help:Warlocks possess natural infravision that grows stronger as they advance,
help: allowing them to see deeper into the shadows they love so much.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned cultists.

class:Paladin
help:A Paladin is a holy warrior. Paladins are exceptional fighters, second
help: only to the warrior class, but less proficient with missile weapons.
help: In close combat, they can strike with their shield to disrupt
help: foes. They combine martial prowess with divine prayers, standing as
help: champions against evil, smiting dark forces and shielding
help: themselves with holy power. Though their magic develops slowly, it grants
help: healing, protection, and strength in battle. Over time, they can bless
help: their weapons and armor, see hidden threats, and find their way through
help: darkness. Paladins receive prayers at a slower pace than priests, but can
help: use all but the most powerful ones.|
help: |
help:Paladins have poor stealth, perception, searching, and magical device use.
help: They have a decent saving throw due to their divine alliance. Their
help: primary stats are strength and wisdom. Their presence commands respect,
help: though it varies among individuals.

class:Rogue
help:A Rogue is a character who prefers to live by their cunning. They blend
help: agility, stealth, and a touch of magic to survive.
help: Though capable of fighting their way out of tight spots, rogues truly
help: excel as masters of traps and stealth, enabling them to avoid many
help: encounters or secure the first strike in combat.
help: They can steal items from monsters, but need to be wary of being caught.
help: Rogues possess unmatched perception, often noticing traps or secret doors
help: before they even look for them.
help: While better with magical devices than combat-focused classes, rogues
help: cannot fully rely on their performance.|
help: |
help:Their spells lack the offensive power of a mage's arsenal, and even the
help: simplest magics may fail until they develop greater intelligence.
help: They use poisons, traps, and darkness to gain the upper hand, slipping
help: away when danger strikes. Their magic helps them navigate, evade, and
help: control the battlefield - just don't ask them to carry your loot.
help: They'll probably "lose" it on the way. |
help: |
help:They gain experience a bit faster than others.

class:Ranger
help:A Ranger is at home in nature, and good at turning the environment to
help: good use. Rangers balance melee prowess with deadly marksmanship,
help: and are among the best of all classes with missile weapons, especially
help: bows.|
help: |
help:Rangers are deeply attuned to nature, drawing strength and resilience from
help: the wild. Forest magic keeps them going long after others would fall.
help: Their connection to the land grants them powerful survival abilities -
help: they can cure themselves with herbs, resist poisons, and never suffer
help: from hunger.
help: They excel at detection and navigation, able to sense nearby life and
help: uncover hidden areas.|
help: |
help:Their arrows strike with deadly precision, often enhanced by nature's power.
help: In battle, Rangers can become swift and relentless, while their tactical
help: skills allow them to shape the environment and stay one step ahead of
help: their foes.|
help: |
help:A Ranger has solid stealth, sharp perception, a knack for searching,
help: strong saving throws, and handles magical devices better than most.
help: Their primary stats are strength, wisdom and dexterity.

class:Blackguard
help:A Blackguard is a brawler of no principle, who lives for the joy of maiming
help: and killing. Blackguards prefer heavy weapons and shields, and learn a few
help: spells for the purpose of wreaking more destruction.
help:They charge into battle, striking with brutal force, stunning, and
help: scattering foes. They regenerate through sheer rage, strike faster,
help: and crush foes with shield blows. Masters of fear, they taunt and break
help: enemy spirits, while bolstering their own with demonic resilience.
help: With time, they can embrace their inner beast, taking the form of a werewolf
help: to wreak even greater havoc. They can summon dark minions, unleash
help: earthquakes, and even take flight when the battle demands.
help: Their lust for blood is legendary, with a blackguard in full cry
help: nigh on impossible to kill.|
help: |
help:Blackguards scorn skills apart from slaughter, and require strength and
help: intelligence (or rat-cunning) to thrive in the dungeon.

class:Sorceror
help:Sorcerers use intelligence primarily, determining how much mana they have to
help: cast spells and how low their failure rate is. They are the greatest
help: wielders of arcane power. Their spells range from simple missiles and
help: beams to storms of mana, tidal waves, and chaotic blasts that tear through
help: entire areas. They control the battlefield - teleporting, reshaping
help: terrain, sealing spaces with runes while defending themselves with mana
help: shields and wraithform. Their unmatched mana reserves and telepathic
help: abilities make them supreme strategists in the dungeon.|
help: |
help:Though a high-level Sorcerer can be very powerful, getting there can be
help: a difficult journey. They are the worst fighters, being unable to use any
help: weapon but a Mage Staff comfortably, and still unable to be even remotely
help: effective with it. A Sorceror has very few hit points compared to other
help: classes, making survival difficult in the beginning. That's why this class
help: is not recommended for beginners. Intelligence is the Sorceror's primary
help: stat.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned arcanists.

class:Unbeliever
help:The full opposite of Sorcerors, Unbelievers so strongly despise magic that
help: not only do they refuse to use magic spells, they refuse all training in the
help: use of magic items, which leaves them totally incompetent when trying
help: to use them, although they can still quaff potions and read scrolls.
help: Their disbelief grants them an anti-magic aura, making magic fizzle nearby.
help: Unbelievers can prevent magical gates from opening around them, eventually
help: extending to a complete suppression of teleportation and all magic in the
help: surrounding area. They replenish their forces when fighting unnatural magic
help: users and can sense invisible creatures in melee range. Their presence can
help: cancel magic effects - when they drink from magic fountains, they often
help: unmagic it. Their sheer will lets them resist most curses, though they
help: can't lift them.|
help: |
help:Even though they despise magical devices, they get along with using staves
help: of teleportation in dire times (though with quite bad fail rate).

class:Hunter
help:Hunters aren't good at fighting, but can shoot and throw faster than others,
help: landing multiple hits quickly. They can die quickly too, however.
help: Hunters are to arrows what Warriors are to melee. They are the best with
help: any bow, crossbow or sling.
help: They can use wide-range of tricks and traps in their hunt in the dungeons.
help: Hunters blend archery and magic, to empower their shots with fire, frost,
help: lightning, acid, poison, and even sound.
help: Their missiles can explode, confuse enemies, pierce armor or combine
help: the forces of nature in a single deadly strike.
help: They sense living creatures nearby, map surroundings,
help: extend their vision, resist poison, cure ailments, and never starve
help: thanks to their unique survival skills.|
help: |
help:Hunter is very bad at melee, being only better than the old saggy sorcerers.
help: Wisdom and dexterity are the hunter's primary stats.|
help: |

class:Telepath
help:The Telepath is a hero who uses the powers of mind instead of magic;
help: mindcrafters, they can weaken or even kill with their wits.
help: Their abilities range from extrasensory perception to mental
help: domination of others.|
help: |
help:Telepaths wield mental blasts, crush minds, confuse and stun their foes.
help: They sense monsters, read thoughts, map surroundings and
help: reveal hidden objects. Their minds can control light, heal their
help: bodies, and resist many dangers. Through telekinesis, they move objects and
help: displace enemies from afar. They shield themselves with force fields,
help: resisting poison, elements and time. Advanced Telepaths manipulate
help: probability, travel through space-time, and unleash devastating waves
help: of pure mental force. Telepaths channel their powers in steady beams,
help: never missing their mark, with minds shielded from amnesia and
help: memory loss. They use the Wisdom score to determine how
help: well they can perform these psychic powers. |
help: |
help:In solo combat, a Telepath is slightly weaker than a Priest, although
help: a Telepath is never penalized for wielding an edged weapon
help: (unlike a Priest).

class:Elementalist
help:Elementalists wield the four elements – Air, Fire, Earth, Water – bending
help: them to their will. They share the bloodline of Mages, but walk a rougher
help: path, caring little for support spells and focusing instead on raw
help: destruction. Walls crumble, storms rage and flood the halls, the stone
help: beneath their feet shifts and turns to mud. Their weapons crackle with
help: elemental power, their bodies shielded from harm by flame, frost, acid
help: and shock. Surges dance at their fingertips, unleashed in bolts, balls,
help: waves and storms. Their elemental spells can form beams, hitting
help: everything in their path. As masters of the elements, they gain intrinsic
help: resistances as they grow: fire at 10, cold at 15, acid at 20,
help: lightning at 25. |
help: |
help:Each time they level up, they can sharpen their craft by studying the
help: same spells again, making each one stronger and more potent.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned conduits.

class:Summoner
help:A Summoner begins their journey frail and defenseless, with little
help: skill in combat and only a handful of minor spells to strike at foes.
help: Yet, their true strength lies elsewhere. With a whispered word or a
help: secret gesture, they call forth creatures who fight in their stead.
help: Though the Summoner keeps a safe distance, the victories of their
help: companions still nourish their growth.|
help: |
help:Summoners master countless summoning rites: from jellies and vortices
help: to hydras. They charm their minions, extend their lifespan, or even
help: make them explode. Their magic extends beyond summoning - they
help: illuminate the darkest corners, sense lurking evil, heal wounds,
help: or open portals to escape trouble. They shield themselves as they grow
help: stronger. Their thunderstorms burst outward, and when needed, they can
help: banish foes or prevent other creatures from calling reinforcements.
help: Some spells don't even drain mana, like calling a swarm of angry bees.|
help: |
help:Wisdom guides their spellcasting and determines how many allies they can
help: control and how effectively they command them. Their natural charisma
help: enhances their magical abilities. While they favor clean, blessed weapons
help: when forced into combat, they remain clumsy with ranged weapons until
help: becoming seasoned masters.

class:Shapechanger
help:Shapechangers possess the ability to transform into various creatures by
help: defeating them in battle. They are fighters that gain abilities from the
help: forms they can mimic. Shapechangers excel in melee combat, benefiting
help: from their current form's advantages (resistances, melee brands, defense,
help: speed, damage boosts). Some forms provide innate spells - from simple
help: strikes to storms, from healing touches to dark summons... and even breath
help: attacks! Some forms whisper of powers that control, others of those that
help: destroy. |
help: |
help:Shapechangers receive basic mana points to cast these spells*.
help: The higher the level of the monster, the more of these
help: creatures the Shapechanger must vanquish before they can assume
help: their form. While transformed, they lose their intrinsic abilities and
help: gain those of the creature they've transformed into, plus whatever
help: abilities and resistances are provided by their equipment. |
help: |
help:Outside of battle, Shapechangers rarely win hearts - their presence is
help: unsettling, something not quite human lingering beneath the surface. |
help: |
help: *Some breath attacks, like for the Dragon race, don't cost mana but
help: hit points instead. Additionally, some races with their own polymorph or
help: shape-shifting abilities have certain restrictions on being Shapechangers.

class:Villager
help:Villagers call themselves plain folk, yet most once spent a season
help: learning under Tom Bombadil. He trusts them with quiet songs and
help: clever seeds, then lets them wander the wider world in his stead.
help: Out on the road they dress like labourers, hiding gifts that might
help: make a stranger uneasy. |
help:A Villager can press a thumb-sized seed into hard ground, hum a short
help: tune, and by dawn a sapling stands guard where bare soil lay. In
help: drizzle they whisper for clear skies; in drought they whistle up
help: gentle rain. Their weather tricks are small — just enough to ease a
help: journey or save a crop — but travellers swear by them all the same. |
help: |
help:Villagers develop keen senses to detect hidden doors, stairs,
help: traps, or lurking monsters while patrolling. In time, Villagers learn
help: to coat their weapons or arrows with poison.
help: Each of these tasks draws upon stamina provided by their constitution.
help: Though modest, these skills help them endure where others might falter. |
help: |
help:In desperate times, when hunger's grip tightens, a Villager may search
help: through abandoned fields in the suburbs - once abundant with harvest,
help: now barren and forsaken, touched by the gods' curse. No livestock
help: remains, and the soil yields almost nothing. Yet with persistence,
help: a Villager might uncover a few forgotten roots or buried crops left
help: behind. It is technically stealing - but when choosing between
help: starvation and salvaging what a farmer abandoned, even the crow
help: claims grain it never sowed. |
help: |
help: They never walk alone - there's always a four-legged friend by their side. |
help: |
help:They can harvest wood and extract ore with increasing efficiency as
help: they gain experience. |
help: |
help:They handle ranged weapons awkwardly until they mature into seasoned
help: adventurers.

class:Tamer
help:Scar-covered hands of a tamer - a person who devoted their life and (remaining)
help: limbs to care for wild creatures - tell you everything about how tedious
help: and dangerous this path is. Dense thickets, burning sands, treacherous
help: mountains - you'll go anywhere to find a dragon in its den... and make
help: friends with it. That is your life's ambition.|
help: |
help:A tamer's body is fragile, but their companion stands between them and
help: danger. Their strength lies in the bond they share with their beasts.
help: Each creature you befriend teaches you something new - a way to fight,
help: to heal, or to endure. A frog's leap through poison clouds, the sharp
help: eye of a falcon, the calming warmth of a bear - all become part of you. |
help: |
help:When wounded in battle, a tamer's companions never truly perish - they retreat
help: to recover, maintaining the mystical bond that allows them to be summoned
help: again when needed. This resilient connection, forged through trust and
help: respect, ensures that a tamer is never truly alone for long.|
help: |
help:Tamers rely not only on their furry friends. They know their own tricks
help: too - how to vanish in a blink, walk unseen, or even command
help: the wilds to part.|
help: |
help:It's not brute strength that tames a beast, but patience, wisdom, and a
help: touch of charm. Animals feel it. They trust you. Sometimes. And with
help: time, maybe even the dragons will.

class:Druid
help:Druids are wanderers of the wild, attuned to the presence of nearby animals
help: and even able to shift into their forms. Skilled in martial arts and
help: avoiding weapons, they also wield nature magic.
help: Every 5 levels they can learn a new animal form to transform into; some
help: forms have innate abilities (to use them, press 'y' key).
help: Druids must find spellbooks in the dungeons; such books are not for sale. |
help: |
help:Druid forms:|
help: |
help:- BIRD: fast and able to fly over water and other terrain; can heal ('y').
help: Fragile and worthless in combat, but can dodge melee attacks well.
help: Resistant to gravity. |
help: |
help:- RAT: harmless and stealthy, rats can find little cracks and holes in the
help: walls to pass through them. They can avoid traps most of the time and are
help: able to sniff items to detect curses on them. Resistant to poison and
help: can life drain. |
help: |
help:- BOAR: finds edible plants which reduce nourishment consumption;
help: good at mushroom identification. Boars are very wise, have high vitality
help: and are fearless. Can charge at enemies from a distance ('y'). |
help: |
help:- CAT: stealthy and nimble. Can backstab sleeping targets.
help: Regenerates especially fast, but poor at mana restoration. |
help: |
help:- WOLF: makes fast vicious attacks; can howl to summon allies ('y').
help: Less resistant to magic, except dark arts. Reckless in defense,
help: but generates rage while in combat. |
help: |
help:- BEAR: tough and powerful, but very noisy and a bit clumsy.
help: Can survive even very harsh blows and curses.
help: Can bash enemies and stun them. |
help: |
help:Druids' hitpoints are not influenced by their forms and they cannot
help: cast spells while in animal form.
help: They are bad at trap disarming and using magical devices.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned sages.

class:Fighter
help:Mercenary who uses different fighting tricks and blows to survive at all
help: costs.
help: They fight dirty if needed, but rely on skill and instinct more than brute
help: force: they dodge, strike back, roll aside, and hit where it hurts the most.
help: Known for their reckless attacks and sudden retreats, fighters balance
help: between luck, experience, and survival instinct. Between fights, they patch
help: themselves up - no wizardry, just rough hands and grit. And as seasoned
help: warriors, they value every calm moment and can take a nap here and there,
help: which helps restore their vigour even after nasty encounters.|
help: |
help:Fighters can sense hidden weapon properties better than others and may
help: identify cursed gear without using magical means.
help: Their focus ("mana" pool) depends on the combination of their strength and
help: intelligence. |
help: |
help:Fighters are very superstitious and believe in fortune.
help: As they care deeply about signs and omens, they may get lucky enough to
help: survive blows that would be mortal wounds for anyone else.

class:Knight
help:Noble knight in heavy armour who charges into enemies with immense power.
help: They cannot be confused and can use their shield with astonishing mastery.|
help: |
help:They can change stances: balanced, defensive, and offensive - switching
help: tactics depending on the situation.|
help: |
help:- Balanced stance steadies the mind, removing confusion.|
help: |
help:- Defensive stance toughens them up, shrugging off stunning blows.|
help: |
help:- Offensive stance fuels their courage, pushing away fear.|
help: |
help:Knights are resilient and disciplined, but lack stealth and magical
help: finesse. They excel in melee combat and can handle crossbows when needed,
help: turning raw strength and endurance into their greatest advantages.|
help: |
help:Their code of honour forbids them from attacking unaware enemies -
help: they always announce themselves before engaging in combat.

class:Traveller
help:"Jack of all trades, master of none..."|
help: |
help:A common soul who knows a bit of magic and isn't too bad with a weapon.
help: Travellers are sure they know everything about maps, directions and
help: cardinal points... but their overconfidence often leads to real trouble.
help: They set out with a handful of useful items, just in case.
help: Seasoned travellers are no strangers to fear; they can teleport, patch
help: themselves up, or conjure a snack when hunger bites. They kindle bonfires
help: to ward off beasts, sketch maps when lost, sense nearby evil, and hurl
help: bolts of fire when words fail. They know how to bless themselves before
help: a fight, discover hidden paths between levels, blink away from danger,
help: and never forget the value of a well-placed glyph.|
help: |
help:The traveller is proud of his cat, who follows him during adventures -
help: always nearby, watching, judging, perhaps luckier than he is.
help: When danger strikes, this feline companion doesn't die but merely vanishes
help: with an indignant flick of its tail, only to reappear later, utterly
help: unimpressed by its master's heroics and ready to be summoned again. |
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned adventurers.|
help: |
help: |
help: |
help:p.s.|
help: |
help:"..though oftentimes better than master of one".|
help: |


class:Bard
help:Expert in musicianship and singing, you can not only bring joy to people,
help: but also know how to use music magic to bring cure and wreak havoc.
help: Bards weave magic into their music - from soothing tunes that mend wounds
help: to thundering chords that shatter walls. Their voice can calm foes or drive
help: them into confusion. When danger rises, they call upon ancient hymns to
help: shield themselves or raise a glyph of protection. Some songs grant speed,
help: some courage, and others strike like a storm.|
help: |
help:Bards are naturally charismatic, charming crowds with ease. Though quite
help: slender, they're surprisingly nimble and quick on their feet.|
help: |
help:They are resistant to sound attacks.

class:Battlemage
help:Battlemages specialize in destroying enemies not only with the power of
help: the elements, but also with skillful melee combat - making them a
help: universal death machine. There's no reason a Battlemage can't become a
help: good fighter, but magic is their true realm.|
help: |
help:Their spells rarely fail, and their magic bends toward battle - layering
help: resistances, hurling lightning and ice, or tearing the earth itself apart.
help: From a spark to a storm, from a stone to a black hole - their arsenal
help: leaves little untouched as they teleport through the fray, strike from
help: unexpected angles, and wield heavy weapons with brutal efficiency. When
help: wounded, they know how to patch themselves up and keep going.|
help: |
help:Unlike other magic users, Battlemages have no trouble wielding ranged
help: weapons or throwing objects.

class:Necromancer
help:Weak and fragile, necromancers wield the power to raise and command armies
help: of the dead - fallen foes rise again at their side. Resistant to nether,
help: they weaken minds, drain life, and summon bone and poison to their advantage.
help: The most powerful necromancers even bind golems to their will.
help: Withered in body and distant in spirit, they rely on intellect and the
help: loyalty of the dead to keep them standing. Their spells rarely fail.
help: With each level, their sight into the darkness sharpens - they see farther
help: where others are blind.
help: Though poor in melee, they siphon a touch of life from living foes - a hint
help: of traumaturgy. And while not skilled fighters, they know how to
help: dig (graves... a professional touch).|
help: |
help:They are clumsy with ranged weapons until their souls wither.

class:Hermit
help:Once frail and burdened by sickness, the hermit turned to the path of light.
help: His body never fully recovered, but his spirit grew unbreakable. A holy monk
help: sworn never to wield a weapon - though his vow doesn't stop him from crushing
help: skulls with bare hands.|
help: |
help:Hermits fight through martial arts and channel sacred light to heal, protect,
help: and strike down evil. Their magic pierces darkness, burns the wicked, and
help: shields from harm. They know secret rituals to bless the ground beneath them
help: or craft sacred water when needed.|
help: |
help:During their quiet, humble training, hermits become stealthier than wind.
help: Their wisdom isn't worn on their sleeve, but it lingers in every step
help: and settles in every strike.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned pilgrims.

class:Wizard
help:A legendary magician, keeper of ancient secrets long forgotten by the world.
help: Their magic isn't about simple fireballs - it warps the fabric of reality
help: itself. A wizard snaps fingers, and the air ripples, twisting enemies into
help: something else entirely - feeding on the chaotic energy left behind.
help: They twist space to blink away, then pull it taut to tear open new paths.
help: Their power distorts the world - sparks jump where none should, frost
help: whispers in circles, and unseen hands shape the fight.
help: When needed, they call the void - unleashing storms that break the ground
help: or tearing the sky to rain down raw magic. Some whisper they've bargained
help: with daemons, but no one dares ask twice. |
help: |
help:Yet wielding such forces comes at a price: their body wears thin against
help: the chaos they summon. Minds burning bright with arcane fire, they grow
help: grumpy, subtle, and quick to anger. Some say they balance on the creeping
help: edge of madness. |
help: |
help:Old wards still linger in their flesh. When their life wanes to a third,
help: forgotten enchantments stir, weaving a shield of mana that holds back death.|
help: |
help:Wizards despise misfiring magic devices and trust only in raw spellcraft.|
help: |
help:They remain clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned magi.

class:Trader
help:An enterprising merchant who went into the dungeon to fulfill his life
help: ambition: get enough money to open his own tavern.
help: Traders aren't fighters, but they know the value of a good bargain.
help: As members of the Traders Guild, they can sell items to NPC stores -
help: something others can't do, since the authorities have declared all dungeon
help: loot "cursed". A rookie trader drives a hard bargain... badly. But with
help: experience, they learn to get better deals. |
help: |
help:Traders aren't just merchants. They know how to sharpen blades,
help: and recharge magical devices - all for the right price.
help: They sense hidden treasures and forgotten paths, guiding their steps.
help: When words fail, they call upon old rituals, asking the gods for a little
help: luck or a bit of chaos. Sometimes both.
help: Their magic isn't flashy, but it keeps them alive - a light in the dark,
help: a potion when needed, a way to carve through stone walls.
help: And when all else fails, they know a trick or two to slip away unnoticed,
help: or send in a decoy to haggle while they make their escape. |
help: |
help:They can bribe intelligent monsters to avoid a fight – if the price is right. |
help: |
help:They carry more than most, their steps less burdened by heavy packs. |
help: |
help:Their gold is safe - even the sneakiest thief leaves empty-handed. |
help: |
help:They identify any item the moment they wield it. |
help: |
help:They never lose their gold, even on the verge of death. |
help: |
help:They can't form a party with other players - the Traders Guild forbids it
help:(and, honestly, they're too greedy to split the loot). |
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned merchants.

class:Assassin
help:Stealthy slayers who blend blades and shadow magic and know 100500
help: different ways to kill their prey fast and effectively.
help: While not true magicians, assassins weave some dark spells into their
help: craft, choosing each one carefully to suit their silent trade.
help: They move swiftly, closing distance in a blink or slipping deeper into the
help: dungeon unseen. Their strikes weaken, poison, and disorient, leaving prey
help: helpless before the final blow.
help: In darker arts, they know how to drain life from foes, vanish into shadows,
help: or shield themselves with pure will. Where others fight openly, assassins
help: control the battlefield long before the enemy realizes - making sure the
help: fight ends before it begins.
help: Most powerful assassins specialize in sentries - magic traps that shoot
help: poison, blades, or elemental bursts at anything crossing their path. |
help: |
help:Assassins use two spellbooks: Shadows for Beginners and Dark Evocations.

class:Phaseblade
help:A warrior who dwells between worlds and feels no weight or spatial burden.
help: They teleport freely and use phase techniques to slice enemies apart.
help: Swords are their weapon of choice; other weapons feel awkward and slow.
help: They are especially annoyed by ranged weapons.
help: They blink around the battlefield, strike and vanish, phase straight
help: into enemies to land a blow, or unleash waves of force that knock foes
help: around. They can restore their strength while phasing, cause earthquakes,
help: teleport monsters away, and even create a circle of warding glyphs
help: when things get too dangerous.|
help: |
help:Their techniques never fail, and they can even teleport from places where
help: others are trapped (with the exception of Titans and Half-Giants).

class:Cryokinetic
help:Some also call them 'Weathermasters'. Cryokinetics can instantly change
help: surrounding temperature to extremes. Few can endure their rapid shifts
help: from burning heat to biting cold.|
help: |
help:At first only their hands may burn or freeze on touch. But soon they start
help: to command waves of flame, unleash plasma and blizzards,
help: and sometimes summon both flame and ice at once. They regenerate fast, dash,
help: and even seal themselves in invulnerable icy cocoons to recover.|
help: |
help:At level 10 they brand their melee blows with fire or cold, and by level
help: 30, they gain innate resistances to both.|
help: |
help:They don't fear lava and can't slip on ice.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned.

class:Timeturner
help:Extremely brittle but lightning fast, they command time through void magic.
help: They age and weaken their enemies, draining life and mana from those with
help: minds. Some foes crumble to dust as time collapses around them.
help: They create shields of time to absorb damage and can rewind wounds,
help: though side effects like blindness or confusion may follow.
help: They slip between dungeon levels, fast forward to deeper depths, or
help: unleash waves of chaotic time to break their foes.|
help: |
help:Speed buffs (e.g. from potions) affect them less and less as they
help: gain levels, since they develop an inner passive speed bonus over time.
help: Also, slowing effects don't cripple them much.|
help: |
help:At the peak of their power they gain resistance to time magic itself.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned seers, but
help:they can be decent melee fighters thanks to their high inner speed.

class:Scavenger
help:Vagabond who ventured to the dungeons to get his hands on monster treasures,
help: but also won't say no to marauding corpses of other adventurers.
help: He's not one to waste time heading back to town - right there, in the
help: depths, he salvages equipment into valuables and keeps moving.
help: Scavengers can salvage ego items at level 20, random artifacts at 30, and
help: true artifacts at 40 and beyond.
help: Experience teaches them how to wring more gold from every scrap. |
help: |
help:But they're not just picking through dungeon trash - they've learned
help: a few dirty tricks along the way.
help: Scavengers can play dead to fool monsters or jump around like grasshoppers.
help: They poison their blades and arrows, map out dungeons, and sniff out hidden
help: treasure. If things get rough, they patch themselves up with bandages,
help: cure poison, and most experienced ones are skilled enough to cause small
help: earthquakes to shake things up. And if all else fails, they've got a
help: backup meal to keep going. Life in the shadows taught them a bit of thievery,
help: though they'll never match a true rogue. But what they lack in finesse,
help: they make up for in strength - able to carry more loot without breaking
help: stride. |
help: |
help:Scavengers are loners by nature - they can't form a party with other players
help: and prefer to work alone. Their only friend is a scrappy little rat - witty,
help: mischievous, and surprisingly affectionate when no one's looking. This rodent
help: companion doesn't truly die when struck down, but scurries off to the shadows
help: with an offended squeak, ready to be called back once the danger passes.
help: The rat's uncanny knack for finding shiny objects often leaves its master
help: wondering who's really in charge of their peculiar partnership.

class:Alchemist
help:Alchemists trust not in steel or sorcery, but in the power of what they brew.
help: Masters of potions, they craft all kinds of mixtures: healing draughts,
help: explosive flasks, corrosive acids, potent poisons, elixirs that boost speed
help: or grant resistances. Some potions reshape the battlefield itself -
help: burning enemies, knocking them back, or even causing trees to sprout from
help: the ground. Just throw them at foes to unleash their power!
help: Other potions restore health or mana, cure poison, or transform
help: the drinker into strange forms for a time. |
help: |
help:To craft a potion, they first gather reagents. Some are organic, found in
help: plants; others are minerals, mined from deep within the earth.
help: Brewing takes time and focus, leaving the alchemist vulnerable while working.
help: Brewed potions are soulbound - only the creator can use them. You can't
help: trade or drop them.
help: To get rid of potions you don't need, press 'k' to destroy them, drink them,
help: or throw them at enemies.|
help: |
help:Beyond potions, alchemists can shroud foes in corrosive fog
help: and heal themselves using gathered herbs. They can even summon a golem
help: to fight by their side!|
help: |
help:They are loners by nature - alchemists trust their craft and their golem,
help: but rarely trust other people. Forming a party with others? Not their way.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned artisans.

class:Crafter
help:Crafters gather resources by chopping trees for logs or mining mountains
help: for ore, then forge their own equipment, shaping weapons and
help: armor to suit their needs. Crafting can be done directly in the dungeon.
help: The higher their level, the better the quality - from simple items to those
help: with magical properties. However, true artifacts can never be crafted.
help: Crafting consumes materials and drains stamina, so choose when to craft
help: wisely. |
help: |
help:Crafter equipment is soulbound and can be used only by its creator;
help: you can't trade it or drop it on the ground.
help: Use the 'k' key to destroy unwanted items. |
help: |
help:Crafters can deploy battle sentries that evolve with experience -
help: from whirling blades and dart launchers to spear throwers, advancing later
help: to acid sprayers, fire turrets, and even storm pillars crackling with
help: lightning. Advanced sentries consume more mana, and insufficient mana
help: can leave the crafter severely exhausted.
help: You can detonate a sentry manually with the '_' key.|
help: |
help:They can also build walls during combat to shape the terrain,
help: blocking enemies or creating cover, though construction takes time. |
help: |
help:Crafters carry heavy loads with less penalty from weight. They are solitary
help: by nature and cannot form parties with others.

class:Inquisitor
help:Inquisitors exterminate heretics, witches and other sacrilege magic riffraff.
help: They despise sorcery and witchcraft, condemning them as black magic and idolatry.
help: Inquisitors refuse to wield magic or use enchanted devices, relying instead
help: on their fists and unwavering determination. Their hatred for magic is so strong
help: that they suppress magical gates and, with experience, can block all arcane
help: forces around them.|
help: |
help:Despite their fanaticism, Inquisitors command forbidden powers through
help: sheer will - either viewing them as divine gifts or acknowledging the truth
help: and wielding these abilities to achieve ruthless goals. Their anti-magic field
help: suppresses external spells, while their own dark rites function within it.
help: They torture minds, drain souls, and call forth hellfire to purge heresy.
help: They descend deeper into the dungeon, drawing strength from tormenting the
help: wicked and summon hounds to aid their crusade. Their curses weaken enemies, walls
help: imprison sinners, and retribution inevitably finds all heretics.|
help: |
help:Though they shun conventional magic, they still quaff potions and read scrolls -
help: minor evils necessary to combat greater ones.|
help: |
help:They prefer breaking bones with their bare hands rather than using weapons...|
help: |
help:They replenish their life force by harming foes who fear them, drawing power
help: from the terror they inspire.|
help: |
help:They're clumsy with ranged weapons until they become seasoned persecutors.

class:Heretic
help:Heretics are outcasts who rejected both sacred and arcane traditions.
help: They wield forbidden power and break the natural laws of magic
help: to bend the elements to their will, using any means necessary -
help: even those unnatural or revolting. |
help:Their spells are never clean: they leave you broken and ruined
help: or shatter your mind. |
help:They thrive in solitude, survive through cunning, and don't hesitate
help: to sacrifice clarity or control for power. |
help:Some say Heretics are mad. Others say they are simply free.

class:Cutthroat
help:You grew up in the gutters - the darkest alleys, the filthiest slums,
help: where people were robbed, beaten, raped, and murdered every single day.
help: In places like that, only the strongest survive… or the most treacherous.
help: You learned early that honor is a weakness and trust is a death sentence.
help: You stole to eat, lied to breathe, and killed before they killed you. |
help:You mastered the art of dirty fighting: stabbing from the shadows,
help: breaking bones when backs are turned, and vanishing before the screams fade.
help: You don’t fight fair - you fight to win, fast and brutal. |
help:Now you walk the world not as a victim, but as a predator,
help: forged in blood and shadow, with no pity left to give.
